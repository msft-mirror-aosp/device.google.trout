Trout AGL Service Yocto Build Layer
===================================

This is a yocto meta-layer defining the build recipes for several Trout AGL services (e.g., vehicle HAL server). This needs to be tested with the AGL BSP source tree.

### Prerequisite

Acquire a Yocto BSP as needed for your use cases.

### Add layers

First copy this directory to `ROOT_OF_AGL_BSP/apps/apps_proc`

```
bitbake-layers add-layer meta-clang meta-google
```

### Copying AGL Services Source Code

This step should be removed in the future. For testing now, the source code of AGL services needs to be manually packed and put to `meta-google/recipes-trout/agl-services/files/google-trout-agl-services.tar.gz`. The package can be generated by

```
PATH_TO_ANDROID_SRCROOT/device/google/trout/agl_services_build/newrepo.sh YOUR_AGL_SRC_PATH
cd YOUR_AGL_SRC_PATH
mv repo google-trout-agl-services
tar -czf google-trout-agl-services.tar.gz google-trout-agl-services/
```

### Build
`bitbake google-trout-agl-services`
